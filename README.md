# Gaussian_Distribution_Python_Package
This project is a part of Udacity's AWS Machine Learning Foundations Course.

In this repo, I developed a python package (How exciting is that!) that is used for analyzing both gaussian and binomial distributions (How not so exciting is that!) .

You can use the package to:

1)Read a dataset

2)Calculate mean

3)Calculate standard deviation

4)Plot histogram

5)Plot propability density function

6)Add two distributions together

The main goal of this assignment is to develop object-oriented programming skills with python, including:

 *   procedural vs object-oriented programming
  *  classes, objects, methods and attributes
   * coding a class
   * magic methods
   * inheritance
